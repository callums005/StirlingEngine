## Member Objects

`m_Window` stores a pointer to the SFML graphics window.
```cpp
sf::RenderWindow* m_Window;
```

---

`m_Width` stores an unsigned integer of the window's width.
```cpp
unsigned int m_Width;
```

---

`m_Height` stores an unsigned integer of the window's height.
```cpp
unsigned int m_Height;
```

`m_Title` stores a string of the window's title.
```cpp
std::string m_Width;
```

## Constructor
```cpp
Window(unsigned int width, unsigned int height, std::string title);
```

## Deconstructor

~Window();
```
